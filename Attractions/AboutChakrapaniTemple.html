      <div class="history">
         <p class="history-content">At a distance of 3 km from Kumbakonam Railway Station, Chakrapani Temple is a 
            Hindu temple situated on the southern bank of Cauvery River in Kumbakonam of Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu. 
            The temple is one of the most prominent temples in Kumbakonam.<br><br>
            
            This temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and appears in the form of a discus or Chakra.
            The images of Chakrapani with eight arms and Sudarshanavalli Thayar with a gracious visage are inspiring.
             Like Shiva, Lord Chakrapani has a third eye on his forehead. 
             Brahma, Surya and Agni are depicted as worshipping the Lord.<br><br>
             According to legend, Sudarshana Chakra, the discus, is the most powerful weapon of god Vishnu.
              He once sent his weapon to Patala Loka to kill the demon Jalandasura. 
              The weapon is believed to have come out of the Patala Loka through river Cauvery.
               God Brahma, who was taking bath in the river, got impressed and installed the image of Sudarshana here. 
               The temple is noted for its exquisite pillars. There is a bronze image of king Serfoji 
             II worshipping the lord as he is said to have been cured an illness by the grace of this God.<br><br>
             Chakrapani Temple attracts devotees who are mentally or physically weakened by illness or problems. 
             The special fire ritual called Sudarshana Homam, Thirumanjanam and Sahasranamarchana are some 
             special pujas held in this temple. Sun God surrendered to Lord at this holy place. Hence, 
             those facing problems due to planetary movements in their life, undergoing the seven and half year 
             Saturn period and the rule of planets Rahu and Ketu are advised to pray to Lord Chakra Raja.<br><br>
             The 10 day Brahmotsavam in Chitirai (April - May), Chariot Festival, Pavitrotsavam, the Float festival or Theppotsavam in Vaikasi are the
              important religious events celebrated at this temple.<br><br>Timings: 6 AM - 12 PM and 4 PM - 8 PM
