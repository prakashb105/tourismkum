      <div class="history">
         <p class="history-content">At a distance of 2.5 km from Kumbakonam Railway Station, Adi Kumbeswarar Temple is a famous Hindu temple located in the center of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. 
            This temple is considered to be the 26th Paadal Petra Sthalam in the Chola kingdom that spread south of the River Cauvery.<br><br>
            Adi Kumbeswarar Temple, also known as Thirukudamooku, is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century CE
            and was renovated by Govinda Dikshitar, the Chieftain of Achutha Nayakar of Thanjavur in the
            16th century AD. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable 
            Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.<br><br>
            According to mythology, when the world was facing destruction due to the devastating tsunami, Lord Brahma approached Lord Shiva to know from where he had to restart creation.
            Lord Shiva suggested that Brahma make a magic pot with the sand collected from various sacred places and floats it in the flood water and also taught the procedure of leaving it on the water.
            Kumbakonam is the place where the pot stopped and then Lord Shiva shot an arrow on the pot. The nectar spilled out and thus life was revived on the earth. A few drops of the nectar 
            fell into a natural cavity in this spot and it became the Mahamaham tank.<br><br>
            Among the most popular <a href="..\Attractions.html">Kumbakonam places to visit,</a> places to visit, 
            the Kumbeswarar Temple is an architectural marvel which reflects the typical
             Dravidian architecture and it covers an area of about 4 acres. This temple consists of three
              Prakaras and three Gopurams. The East Gopuram comprises 9 stories with a height of 128 ft.

            at the bottom and narrows at the top in the shape of a needle. 
            Kumbeswarar Lingam believed to have been made by Shiva himself when he mixed
             nectar of immortality and sand. Goddess Manthrapeeteswari Mangalambika is his consort 
             and her shrine is situated to the left of the Kumbeswarar shrine. The unique feature of this 
             temple is the 27-star sign and 12 sun shines that are sculptured in a large block of stone.
